/tmp/test_volumedata is not a block device.
mkntfs forced anyway.
The sector size was not specified for /tmp/test_volumedata and it could not be obtained automatically.  It has been set to 512 bytes.
The partition start sector was not specified for /tmp/test_volumedata and it could not be obtained automatically.  It has been set to 0.
The number of sectors per track was not specified for /tmp/test_volumedata and it could not be obtained automatically.  It has been set to 0.
The number of heads was not specified for /tmp/test_volumedata and it could not be obtained automatically.  It has been set to 0.
To boot from a device, Windows needs the 'partition start sector', the 'sectors per track' and the 'number of heads' to be set.
Windows will not be able to boot from this device.
